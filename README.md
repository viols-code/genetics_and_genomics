# Genetics and Genomics course

## Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks exploring different aspects of genetics and genomics. The first notebook focuses on a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) related to caffeine consumption, while the second examines single-cell data to identify cell types.

## Notebooks

### 1. Caffeine Consumption through a GWAS Lens
**Objective:**
Investigate the genetic factors associated with caffeine consumption using a GWAS approach.

**Key Steps:**
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting genotype and phenotype data.
- GWAS analysis: Identifying significant genetic variants associated with caffeine consumption.
- Results visualization: Creating Manhattan and QQ plots to interpret findings.

### 2. Where do my single cells come from?
**Objective:**
Classify single cells into their respective cell types based on provided genomic data.

**Key Steps:**
- Data preprocessing: Normalizing and filtering single-cell data.
- Classification: Assigning cell types using clustering.
- Results visualization: Plotting PCs and other visualizations to show cell-type clusters.
